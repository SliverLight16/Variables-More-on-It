initMass = Get next input

// Get growth rate. Ex 0.05 is 5%/year
growthRate = Get next input

yearsGrow = Get next input

//Ex. Rate of 0.05 yields initMass *1.05*yearsGrow
finalMass = initMass * RaiseToPower(1.0 + growthRate, yearsGrow)

Put "Final mass after " to output
Put yearsGrow to output
Put " years is: " to output
Put finalMass to output
